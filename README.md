# **Eye-Movement**

## **Description**

This project was coded in Javascript. It created a pair of eyes placed in the middle of the screen and it involves an on mouse move event. As the user moves the mouse cursor around the page, the pair of eyes track the mouse movement.


## How to Run

Download all the files and make sure they are all stored within the same folder. The game will then run locally by opening the index.html file in a browser.


## Planned Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add eyelashes and a smile to the image. I will also change the background color.
